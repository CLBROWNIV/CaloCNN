# CaloCNN

Code for Convolutional Neural Network for analyzing calorimeter hits
ConvolutionNN is constant learning rate, updatedCNN is stepped learning rate
ENERGYTEST is to test data with a trained model

NN files requires two txt files, output.txt and energy.txt
output.txt contains all events, with raw qdc given in 8x8 arrays
energy.txt contains all energies, from the ph variable in pbglass_digit
